This repository is created for the blogs that I post on Medium.


### 1.  [[Blog Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-text-normalizer-using-nltk-ft-pos-tagger-e713e611db8)]Building a Text Normalizer using NLTK ft. POS tagger  

Code - [Text_Normalization_ft_POS_Tagger.ipynb](https://github.com/royn5618/Medium_Blog_Codes/blob/master/Text_Normalization_ft_POS_Tagger.ipynb)

Summary: An nltk implementation of basic text cleaning and normalization techniques using POS tagger.

### 2.  Blogs on Covid-19 News Articles
[[Blog Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-news-about-covid-19-in-indian-media-nlp-wordcloud-covid-19-article-1-2bcbb127dfb3)] Exploring News about Covid-19 in Indian Media | NLP| Wordcloud | Covid-19 Article 1 

[[Blog Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/extracting-features-from-covids-news-a-simple-bag-of-words-approach-for-time-series-text-data-bffe59de76a1)] Extracting Features From Covidâ€™s News: A Simple Bag-of-Words Approach for Time-Series Text Data Modelling | Covid-19 Article 2

Code for Scraping - [Git Repository NLP_using_News_API](https://github.com/royn5618/NLP_using_News_API)

Jupyter Notebooks: https://github.com/royn5618/Medium_Blog_Codes/tree/master/Covid-Blog-Codes

Summary: COVID-19 has turned the world upside-down. The global buzzwords are now coronavirus, death, quarantine and lockdown. So, in this blog, I attempted to dig into the news articles from Indian media and visualize which words appeared the most using a wordcloud. I also explored further into the texts and try to establish significant correlations between features extracted from the texts using Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach. ** Work in progress **


### 3.  Blogs on Predicting Hazardous Seismic Bumps 

[[Blog Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-hazardous-seismic-bumps-using-supervised-classification-algorithms-part-i-2c5d21f379bc)] Predicting Hazardous Seismic Bumps Part I : EDA, Feature Engineering & Train Test Split for Unbalanced Dataset

[[Blog Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-hazardous-seismic-bumps-part-ii-training-supervised-classifier-models-and-8b9104b611b0)] Predicting Hazardous Seismic Bumps Part II: Training & Tuning Supervised ML Classifiers and Model Performance Analysis

Code - https://github.com/royn5618/Medium_Blog_Codes/blob/master/Predicting%20Hazardrous%20Seismic%20Bumps/Predicting_Seismic_Bumps.ipynb

Summary - The seismic bumps dataset is one of the lesser-known binary classification datasets that capture geological conditions using seismic and seismo-acoustic systems in longwall coal mines to assess if they are prone to rockburst causing seismic hazards or not.
